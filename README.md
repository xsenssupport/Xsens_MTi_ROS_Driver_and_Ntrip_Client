This code was based on the official Xsens 2025.0 [Open source Xsens Device API](https://base.movella.com/s/article/Introduction-to-the-MT-SDK-programming-examples-for-MTi-devices) tested on MTi-680G/MTi-8/MTi-630/MTi-300 with ROS2 Humble at Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS .

## ROS vs ROS2 Versions

Note that this branch contains the `ROS2` implementation that is compatible for `Humble` and `Jazzy`. 

If you are looking for the `ROS1` version, you should go to the [`main`](https://github.com/xsenssupport/Xsens_MTi_ROS_Driver_and_Ntrip_Client/tree/main) branch.

And if you are looking for the `ROS2 Foxy` version, you should go to the [`ros2-foxy`](https://github.com/xsenssupport/Xsens_MTi_ROS_Driver_and_Ntrip_Client/tree/ros2-foxy) branch.

## How to clone this ROS2 branch

```
git clone --recursive --branch ros2 https://github.com/xsenssupport/Xsens_MTi_ROS_Driver_and_Ntrip_Client.git
```

## Device Settings - Output Configurations
#### Note: the UTC Time, SampleTimeFine, Status Word, Latitude and Longitude needs to be enabled, in order to get GPGGA data for topic ``/nmea``: MT Manager - Device Settings - Output Configuration , select "UTC Time, Sample TimeFine, Status Word, Latitude and Longitude" and other required data, click "Apply"

Here are the recommended Output Configurations and Device Settings:

## Changes made to the MTi ROS Driver:

 - Fix the fix_type of the ``/nmea`` GPGGA topic to align with NMEA standards.
 - Add: 
    - +Sensor ouput configurations; 
    - +Sensor Filter Settings;
    - +Setting baudrate; 
    - +Setting GNSS Lever Arm for MTi-8/MTi-680(G)
    - +Setting u-Blox GNSS Platform
    - +Option Flags Settings(AHS,In-Run Compass, Beidou, OrientationSmoother, PositionVelocitySmoother, ContinousZRU); 
    - +Manual Gyro Bias Estimation Periodically
    - +Add ``filter/euler`` and high rate topics for ``imu/acceleration_hr``, ``imu/angular_velocity_hr``
    - +Add error messages.

- change:
    - ``lib/xspublic/xscontroller/iointerface.h``, line 138, change to ``PO_OneStopBIt`` for PO_XsensDefaults.
    - ``lib/xspublic/xscommon/threading.cpp``, updated to work with glibc 2.35.

## Ntrip_Client
The Ntrip_client subscribes to the ``/nmea`` rostopic from ``xsens_mti_ros2_driver``, and wait until it gets data for maximum 300 sec, it will send GPGGA to the Ntrip Caster(Server) every 1 second.

User needs to change the ``ntrip_launch.py`` for their own credentials/servers/mountpoint. 

## How to Install:
install dependency:
```
sudo apt install ros-[ROSDISTRIBUTION]-nmea-msgs
sudo apt install ros-[ROSDISTRIBUTION]-mavros-msgs
```
for example for ROS2 Humble:
```
sudo apt install ros-humble-nmea-msgs
sudo apt install ros-humble-mavros-msgs
```

change the NTRIP credentials/servers/mountpoint in ``src/ntrip/launch/ntrip_launch.py`` to your own one.


copy the `src` folder to your ``ros2_ws`` folder, and run the code below:
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```

Source the ``install/setup.bash`` file inside your ROS2 workspace
```
source install/setup.bash
```
or 

add it into rules:
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```
At the end of the file, add the following line:
```
source /home/[USER_NAME]/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
save the file, exit.

Note: If you don't add this source line to your `~/.bashrc`, then every time you open a new terminal, you will have to firstly do `source install/setup.bash`, otherwise you couldn't read the `/status` topic data.

## How to Use:
open first terminal:
```
ros2 launch xsens_mti_ros2_driver xsens_mti_node.launch.py
```
or with the 3D display rviz:
```
ros2 launch xsens_mti_ros2_driver display.launch.py
```
and then open another terminal
```
ros2 launch ntrip ntrip_launch.py
```

## How to confirm your RTK Status

you could check ``ros2 topic echo /rtcm``, there should be HEX RTCM data coming,

or ``ros2 topic echo /status`` to check the RTK Fix type, it should be 1(RTK Floating) or 2(RTK Fix).

## Troubleshooting

- Refer to the [README.txt](./src/xsens_mti_ros2_driver/README.txt)
- nVidia Jetson devices, ref to [Interfacing MTi devices with the NVIDIA Jetson](https://base.movella.com/s/article/article/Interfacing-MTi-devices-with-the-NVIDIA-Jetson-1605870420176) 
- Docs, ref code: [All MTi Related Documentation Links](https://base.movella.com/s/article/All-MTi-Related-Documentation-Links)
- Regarding Parameters: If you have previously run `colcon build` and then changed the credentials in ntrip or YAML parameters, you will need to run `colcon build` again after making those changes. Otherwise, it won't work for ROS 2.
